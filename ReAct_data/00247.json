Journal bearings play a crucial role in various applications, including turbines, compressors, and engines, where they support rotating shafts. The study highlights that aerodynamic journal bearings offer several advantages over conventional hydrodynamic bearings, such as reduced friction, increased load capacity, and improved stability.\\n\\nResearchers have conducted extensive experiments and simulations to investigate the performance of aerodynamic journal bearings. They have found that parameters like bearing clearance, rotor speed, and inlet pressure significantly affect the bearing's characteristics. Additionally, the use of various techniques, such as active control and surface texturing, has shown potential in enhancing bearing performance.\\n\\nDespite significant progress in understanding and optimizing aerodynamic journal bearings, there are still areas that require further exploration.

A study analyzed the publication and citation patterns of 1,500 journals in various scientific disciplines. The results revealed that international collaboration is a key factor in determining the internationalization of a journal. Journals with a higher percentage of internationally co-authored papers were found to have a broader citation scope, indicating a more global impact. Additionally, journals that published papers from a wider range of countries and cited papers from a broader set of countries were considered more internationalized. The study also found that journals in disciplines such as physics and mathematics tend to be more internationalized compared to those in social sciences and humanities. Overall, the findings suggest that international collaboration and diversity in publication and citation patterns play a significant role in the internationalization of scientific journals.'}"], ["FinishAction", "The research articles within the journal's scope have been found using GoogleScholar.
